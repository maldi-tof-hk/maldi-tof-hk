# Application of Machine Learning with MALDI-TOF MS for Rapid Differentiation between Methicillin-susceptible and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

This repository contains code for data processing, model training, evaluation and data analysis. Code that replicate study data and figures can be found in the `scripts` directory, while various figures and tables generated by models trained on the dataset can be found in the `data` directory. 

The preprocessed dataset used in this study is available at https://doi.org/10.34740/kaggle/ds/8530935

## Technical note

- Required Python and package versions are listed in `.python-version` and `requirements.txt`
- All Python files import modules using relative paths from the root of this repository. Please add a `.pth` file pointing to this repository in your `site-packages` folder for module imports to function properly
- This project uses Tensorflow v2.15.1 which no longer supports GPU aceleration on Windows. If you are using Windows, you should execute training scripts in a CUDA-enabled WSL environment to leverage GPU acceleration

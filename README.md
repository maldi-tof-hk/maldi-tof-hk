# Application of Machine Learning with MALDI-TOF MS for Rapid Differentiation between Methicillin-susceptible and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

This repository contains code that replicates data and figures included in the study. The MALDI-TOF spectra and antibiogram are not publicly available,
but source code not specific to the dataset, including data processing, model training, evaluation and data analysis, can be found in this repository.
Various figures and tables generated by models trained on the private dataset can also be found in the `data` directory.

## Technical note

- Required Python and package versions are listed in `.python-version` and `requirements.txt`
- All Python files import modules using relative paths from the root of this repository. Please add a `.pth` file pointing to this repository in your `site-packages` folder for module imports to function properly
- This project uses Tensorflow v2.15.1 which no longer supports GPU aceleration on Windows. If you are using Windows, you should execute training scripts in a CUDA-enabled WSL environment to leverage GPU acceleration
